# Path_Tinkering

This project is a mess of python intended to help me learn OpenGL
and to use it for creating CNC Milling Machine toolpaths.

The software written here was inpsired by this paper,
"Automated CNC Tool Path Planning and Machining Simulation on 
Highly Parallel Computing Architectures": https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2780&context=all_dissertations
